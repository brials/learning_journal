#Code 201 Learning Journal Day 8

Over the past two days we have been learning all about the DOM and how to append items to it. This has included in response to javascript events and the listeners and handler functions associated with those. I feel like I have had a pretty good understanding of them and actually feel these are pretty intuitive. I have been able to keep my assignments organized into logical though processes and I believe that has really helped. As long as I know everything that is going on in my code I can easily add to it. If I don't know what exact command I need to use the internet is there for me to look it up. A lot of our code lately can be pretty much boiled down to thinking about "ok what do I want to do" and then just thinking about that. After that executing is usually pretty simple. That is pretty much the problem domain in action I guess.
