# LJ Code 201 - Day 1

Today was interesting. There was a lot of review of simple concepts.
I am looking forward to getting into more advanced topics as we seem to have covered
most of what was in the prework. I should continue to practice my Unix commands when I can and try not to use
my file folders any more as it is just good practice.
