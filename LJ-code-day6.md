# LJ Code 201 Day 6

Today we went over the core of the project domain as well as the DOM and object literal notation.
I found this was a pretty productive day and I enjoyed thinking about the project. I created a
set of code for the object that had one method for the printing to the ul element on the console of
the times and cookies sold. Because of the fact that the schedule went from am hours to 12pm to 1pm
(12 to 1 where usually just counts up one.) my method had 2 for loops with almost identical guts
and a chunk of code that was almost identical to that between the two loops for noon. I wonder if
there may have been a more elegant way for me to design those loops so that I didn't need the
large block of code it became.
