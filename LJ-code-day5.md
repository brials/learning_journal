#Code 201 -Day 5

Today is technically day 4 so I am making this as of Thursday however the assignment is due Friday morning so I am  making this now for that reason.
We were able to go really deep into some of the coding problems on the guessing game. The contributor to the code demo was able to do the first 5 of the questions using a series of arrays. I want to be able to do that. I figure a good way to do this would be to assign certain positions of each array to different things such as position 1 is only questions and position 6 is the answer if they submit a y or yes.
Shelly and I were able to successfully turn each other's codes into functions. I am excited for when we don't have to look over each other's shoulder.

Updating for day 5.
Learned about the git process for working with branches. It hasn't gotten to the point where we can both work on the same code at the same time as although we are on different laptops working on the same project we have to wait for the update. I am excited to be able to do larger projects with multiple people working like a real project. We also went over using functions that call other functions. It can be very important to remember what each function is returning especially when it returns an array so you can mark off what position you want to reference if you don't want the entire array.
