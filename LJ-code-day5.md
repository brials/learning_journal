#Code 201 -Day 5

Today is technically day 4 so I am making this as of Thursday however the assignment is due Friday morning so I am  making this now for that reason.
We were able to go really deep into some of the coding problems on the guessing game. The contributor to the code demo was able to do the first 5 of the questions using a series of arrays. I want to be able to do that. I figure a good way to do this would be to assign certain positions of each array to different things such as position 1 is only questions and position 6 is the answer if they submit a y or yes.
Shelly and I were able to successfully turn each other's codes into functions. I am excited for when we don't have to look over each other's shoulder.
