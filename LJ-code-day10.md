# Learning Journal Day 10 Events and CSS

This week we learned about all sorts of Javascript events and about DOM manipulation. We also learned about CSS styling and making a wireframe for your site. These will be very useful going forward and I feel like I have a firm handle on how these work. I am going to be looking to improve upon my abstraction concepts so I can think up ideas for them myself. As for CSS I am definitely improving but will just need to take my time and plan out what I am going for when dealing with that. Wire framing should help with this.
