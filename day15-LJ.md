#Day 15 Learning Journal.

Over the last couple of days in actual class lecture we learned about advanced javascript properties. We also learned about the git team work process.
This has been extremely informative and helpful in working with the project so far. It seems rather easy to manage it with all of us here but I imagine it is much more difficult with people in different locations. I am looking forward to applying some of those javascript techniques as well as some new concepts we didn't learn in class to the project.
