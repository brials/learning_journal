#Code 201 -Day 3

Over the past couple days we have learned a lot about git hub and javascript. Most of it has been review from some of the pre-work which was a bit surprising to me as I thought we might get going on higher concepts a little bit faster. The Git info has been really interesting and the main thing I can still do is that I can usually look up anything we are talking about for reference or a 2nd point of view if needed. I will continue to absorb things as we finish our weekly project for Friday.
