# Code 201 Day 13 Learning Journal.

Today we pair programmed and I was with Alejandro. It went really well. We were able to figure out local storage which besides remembering to stringify and parse isn't all that hard. I was using prototype inappropriately so that came to bite me but we were able to figure that out so I just set the values in the constructer. Tomorrow we will learn the proper way so I am excited for that.
